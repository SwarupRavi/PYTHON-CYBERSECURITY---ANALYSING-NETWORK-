This project is done for analysing the packet exchange between 2 diff IPs using wireshark.

There are 2 python scripts written for this.

The network traffic data is taken from wireshark software.

It is downloaded into a kml format and then called into the python script..

It then shows the packet location in between 2 IPs..
